## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was a good challenge. Spending more days on this helped me have
more insight of web designing. I learned some new things in html, css and js:

```html
<section>How to manage sections in a project</section>
```

```css
p {
  white-space: pre-line;
}
```

```js
// and how to add/remove classes from elements using javascript
function toExit() {
  menuButton.classList.add("hide");
}
```

### Continued development

I really want to be comfortable with <select> ` <select>` </select> tag and its properties plus a way to style them, and also
want to be good at styling navigation items.

### Useful resources

  comfortable with displaying elements on a page using `flex`
